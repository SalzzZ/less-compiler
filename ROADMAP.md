## Feature Roadmap

 * Less 2.x support.  Next major work will be to support all features in
   [less.js][lessjs], while keeping 1.3.3 backwards-compatability.
 * More specific error messages in certain situations.  For example, parser
   can catch some invalid syntax before runtime does.
 * Optional plugins for JavaScript support, via Rhino and Java 8's JS engine.
 * Scalability tests.
 * Interface for detailed parse, compile / evaluation phase timings.
 * Optional collection and reporting of parse/compile statistics.
